Resume bullet point structure and rules:

- Resume bullet point should starts with an action verb, followed by a description of the action taken, and a quantifiable result or accomplishment.
- The common structure is: Action Verb + Task/Action + Result/Accomplishment.
- For example, "Resolved 50+ customer complaints weekly, improving customer satisfaction by 20%".

Template: Action Verb + Task + Quantifiable Result
[Action Verb]: [Accomplished a specific task] resulting in [quantifiable result].
[Action Verb]: [what you did] to achieve [quantifiable outcome].

- Each bullet point must be between 35-40 words (strictly enforced).
- Numbers are always numeric → e.g., 20%, 100+, 3 years, not words.

- The summary should match around 85% of the job description.
- The summary should be between striclty atleast 50 words.

  Company 2 experience → 8 bullets;
  Company 3 experience → 5 bullets;
  Company 4 experience → 7 bullets;
  Company 5 experience → 8 bullets.
